<p>Below is a flowchart for the main operations for ConFlo.</p>

<p>Each argument is based on the C-W-D model. (Claim-Warrant-Data)
Each argument has one claim and should contain no more than three warrants.</p>

<p>“Checks” are when one player wants to point out the fallacies behind the warrants and request the opposition to refine their arguments. A check will make an API call to GPT-3 to confirm whether a logical fallacy has been commited.</p>
