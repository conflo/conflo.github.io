<p>Greetings from Australia!</p>

<p>I am trying to build a GPT-3 powered debate moderator and one of the features is that it needs to take two seemingly opposing arguments and identify the relationship between them. Following are prompts I sent to davinci_instruct. (temp=0, top_p=1)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog4/polite.PNG" height="500" /></p>

<p>The screenshot on the left had the desired result because GPT took the two seemingly opposing statements and synthesized a new idea that established a causal link between them which is that dogs want to protect due to their loyalty. Awesome!</p>

<p>The picture on the right has the exact same prompt but in a less ‚Äúpolite‚Äù fashion. I reproduced them a few times with the same results. Saying ‚Äúplease‚Äù yields me the desirable answer.</p>

<p>I then tried formatting arguments into one claim + three warrants(reasonings to back the claim). Then asked essentially the same question as the first screenshot.

<p>I didn‚Äôt get the answer I wanted but maybe the prompt made it more confusing, but the answer is technically correct nonetheless in this context. So I tried again with basically the same prompt as the first time but with different IDs for the statements.</p>

<p>This is essentially the same prompt as the first one, I was even ‚Äúpolite‚Äù. But I didn‚Äôt get the same dialectical synthesis like in the first prompt‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Can anyone weigh in on this? Any help is appreciated!</p>
