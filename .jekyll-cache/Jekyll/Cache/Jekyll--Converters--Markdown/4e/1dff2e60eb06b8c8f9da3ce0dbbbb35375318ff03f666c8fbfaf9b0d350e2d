<p>I took Josh Bachynski’s advice and changed up the prompts a little bit to see if I could get GPT to do better dialectics. His advice was as follows:</p>

<p>1.) Lose the coding for statements - this can confuse GPT as any additional information or unnecessary formatting can throw it off in giving desired answers, if I don’t want structure, don’t give it any to look for<br />
2.) Switch to the Q&amp;A format<br />
3.) Give really good examples<br />
4.) Keep it simple and keep temperature at 0</p>

<p>I gave it two examples with one worded answers and what resulted was a old wise man type answering bot.

<p>All the answers were very sensible and a teeny bit cryptic and would probably require the interpreter to ponder a little bit to see how it connects the two seemingly conflicting statements. Highlight being:</p>

<p>Q: How can Bing compete with Google?<br />
A: Differentiation.</p>

<p>LOL! It’s like GPT knows Bing cannot compete on a level playing field.</p>

<p>Also, it’s pretty awesome that Josh took the time to answer my question with such a long response. And he’s a Ted talker too! I can’t say I’m not a little bit star-struck.</p>

<p>Newport’s book, “Deep Work” had inspired me to start time-blocking my day to fit in at least 3 x 1.5 hour sessions of deepwork every weekday.</p>
