<p>It wasnâ€™t hard to convert the wise-man app to vuex, a few things I got hung up on</p>

<p>1.) I couldnâ€™t access the state variables from actions, turned out I couldnâ€™t just use this.$store.state.var, instead, I needed to pass in context to actions as a parameter then do either context.state.var or use getters like context.getters.getVar<br />
2.) Turns out Vuex store doesnâ€™t have a created() hook so I couldnâ€™t initialize the openAI wrapper<br />
3.) I should only mutate variables using mutations<br />
4.) spreading mapMutations/mapGettersâ€¦etc is only for using them in the DOM, otherwise, I can call this.$store.commit/dispatch(payload) in component script<br />
5.) I think I should only use getters, thereâ€™s a complicated reason for it but itâ€™s quite nuanced according to the documentation.<br />
6.) Apparently, in v-for, using index as key can be problematic if the array is mutable, e.g if you delete an item, the items behind will get assigned new index numbers, using a uuid for key is much better<br />
7.) Html class attribute can be dynamic by passing in logical evaluation, this is useful in style</p>
