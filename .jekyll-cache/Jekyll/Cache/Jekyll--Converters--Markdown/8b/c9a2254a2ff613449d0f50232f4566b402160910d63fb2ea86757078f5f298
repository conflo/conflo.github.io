<p>I had started prototyping the one-player mode for ConFlo, I had decided on a card game type of layout.</p>

<p>Each card is clickable and will expand into a v-dialog where you can view the warrants for each claim and any relevant evidence. I should use expansion panels for warrant details and nest more panels for any relevant data.</p>
