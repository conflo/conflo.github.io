<p>Managed to make a semi-serviceable prototype using Codex.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog9/Capture.PNG" height="500" /></p>

<p>One problem with Codex sandbox is that the window object doesnâ€™t work, so I cannot do pop-up prompts for inputs. Eventually, I will have to move on to some kinda frontend framework for my MVP anyways, so Iâ€™m back to Vue.</p>

<p>Since ConFlo is mainly just text input and output, retrieving conversations and calling the openai API here and there, itâ€™s not very hardware reliant, I wouldnâ€™t need to develop natively. Besides, I suspect for intense conversations that possibly has a time limit, people would prefer to have a proper keyboard. Itâ€™s a bonus if mobile users want to use the PWA. Apparently quest 2 can do PWAs in firefox reality and the oculus browser, thatâ€™s pretty interesting too.</p>

<p>I will keep using Codex to help me test JS stuff though.</p>

<p>Vue is good for MVP prototyping and I kinda know it so itâ€™s a no brainer.</p>

<p>For storing conversations I will probably be using firebase or just some local file somewhere, at least for the prototype.</p>

<p>MVP must haves:</p>

<p>1.) Player UI<br />
2.) Both players connected to the same session and having a conversation concurrently<br />
3.) Prompts for formatting the conversation</p>

<p>Basically I will just need to find the most simple chat app tutorial, build it and repurpose some stuff for the formatting. Shouldnâ€™t take more than a weekâ€¦ I hope.</p>
