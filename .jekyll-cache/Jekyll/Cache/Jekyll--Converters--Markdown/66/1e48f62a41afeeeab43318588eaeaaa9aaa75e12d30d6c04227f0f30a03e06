<p>I had started prototyping the one-player mode for ConFlo, I had decided on a card game type of layout.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/blog16/cards.PNG" height="500" /></p>

<p>Each card is clickable and will expand into a v-dialog where you can view the warrants for each claim and any relevant evidence. I should use expansion panels for warrant details and nest more panels for any relevant data.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/blog16/cardClicked.PNG" height="500" /></p>

<p>Tomorrow, I will work on:</p>

<p>1.) Color of top bar should correspond to the color of the card clicked (maybe graded to the strength of claim?)<br />
2.) Expansion panels/treeview for warrants and data<br />
3.) Plan opposition actions for manipulating each claim card (fallacies? start dialog to clarify?)\</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>1.) v-timeline would be nice for a top-level view of progression of arguments<br />
2.) I should implement all desired functionalities and THEN decide on the flow of actions (for one player mode, I will need the player to switch perspectives at the right time to argue against himself)<br />
3.) A dialog should be able to be opened on cards that require clarification, I will also need to decide what players can do with oppositionsâ€™ cards and also their own.<br />
4.) Progress and the app is materializing. I feel great!</p>
