<h3 id="testing-gpt-3">Testing GPT-3</h3>
<p>Today I was playing around with GPT-3(specifically davinci-instruct). I find that it’s plenty capable of understanding the context of a conversation and can detect when the context changes. This can be helpful for identifying parallel conversations.</p>

<p>It can also detect causal links between seemingly contradictory statements but it took a lot of refinement of asking the right questions in order to get the desired answers.</p>

<p>The goal is for GPT-3 to see the link between the two statements:
(1) Dogs are loyal.
(2) Dogs are dangerous.</p>

<p>The synthesis of these two statements requires introducing a third idea, which is that dogs want to protect their owners due to their loyalty; which causes them to be dangerous.</p>
