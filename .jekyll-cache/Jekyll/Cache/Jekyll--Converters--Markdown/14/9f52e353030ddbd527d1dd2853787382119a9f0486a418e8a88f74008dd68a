<p>Vuetify is great for prototyping user interface since I wouldnâ€™t have to type my own html or do any of my own css.<br />
Made a simple todo app today using just vuetify components today.

<p>Next is to properly design the debate interface and try out different prompts for appending text to the main text output field. 
I will be using vue3 with the alpha version of vuetify and reproduce the three column wire-frame from v2.x. For now it will be one person arguing both sides.</p>
