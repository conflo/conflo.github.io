<p>I took Josh Bachynskiâ€™s advice and changed up the prompts a little bit to see if I could get GPT to do better dialectics. His advice was as follows:</p>

<p>1.) Lose the coding for statements - this can confuse GPT as any additional information or unnecessary formatting can throw it off in giving desired answers, if I donâ€™t want structure, donâ€™t give it any to look for<br />
2.) Switch to the Q&amp;A format<br />
3.) Give really good examples<br />
4.) Keep it simple and keep temperature at 0\</p>

<p>I gave it two examples with one worded answers and what resulted was a old wise man type answering bot.

<p>The following are the  exact instructions I gave it.</p>

<p>1.) â€œcreate a text field 500px x 300pxâ€<br />
2.) â€œcreate a small input field below(the text field)â€<br />
3.) â€œcreate a buttonâ€<br />
4.) â€œcreate a var called keyâ€(in which I stored the API key, donâ€™t think about stealing it, I rotate it often)<br />
5.) â€œwhen the button is pressed, call the openai api with the key as api key and the text from inputField as prompt. return the response and append it to the output box.â€<br />
6.) â€œcreate a button called instructâ€<br />
7.) â€œcreate a button called delete, when clicked, clear all the text in the output box.â€<br />
8.) â€œwhen instruct is clicked, it should call the openai api at the davinci-instruct-beta-v3 engine. output token should be limited to 120. use the text in the inputField as the prompt and key as the api key.â€\</p>

<p>8 English sentences to build an app. Amazing.</p>

<p>I then exported it to JSFiddle.</p>

<p>Then I copied the html and pasted it into a file then started a python web server.</p>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p>Now all to do is to fine-tune the engine to make it give more â€œprofessionalâ€ advice.
You can always convert an excel spreadsheet to JSON and feed it to the engine.</p>
