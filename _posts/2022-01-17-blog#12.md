### The Wise Man in Vue
Built the wise-man from scratch in Vue. It's supposed to give one-worded answers for questions regarding two seemingly conflicting/opposing ideas or attributes.

A couple of things I learned:

1.) Environment variables are put in .env files and will need to restart the server for it to update.\\
2.) Parents can only catch events from child componenets WITHIN the child components 
(e.g. If I $emit an event from a Footer component, I can't catch it in a random div component.)\\
3.) Making API calls to openai and then parsing the text from the results wasn't that hard. \\
4.) Padding the prompt and using stop sequences "\n" stands for new line. \\
5.) I used the created life cycle hook to initialize the openai object with the api_key env variable. (using the openai client module from github)

```javascript
const OpenAI = require('openai-api');

// Load your key from an environment variable or secret management service
// (do not include your key directly in your code)
const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

const openai = new OpenAI(OPENAI_API_KEY);
```

### Things to improve/Do tomorrow

1.) Convert the vue app to a vuex app.\\
2.) Use my own "uncle" graphic.\\
3.) Include header and footer?\\
4.) loading animation (make uncle look like he's thinking) while awaiting api response\\
