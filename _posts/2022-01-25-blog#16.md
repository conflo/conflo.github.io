### ConFlo MVP Update #1

I had started prototyping the one-player mode for ConFlo, I had decided on a card game type of layout.

Each card is clickable and will expand into a v-dialog where you can view the warrants for each claim and any relevant evidence. I should use expansion panels for warrant details and nest more panels for any relevant data.

Tomorrow, I will work on:

1.) Color of top bar should correspond to the color of the card clicked (maybe graded to the strength of claim?)\\
2.) Expansion panels/treeview for warrants and data\\
3.) Plan opposition actions for manipulating each claim card (fallacies? start dialog to clarify?)\\


Notes

1.) v-timeline would be nice for a top-level view of progression of arguments\\
2.) I should implement all desired functionalities and THEN decide on the flow of actions (for one player mode, I will need the player to switch perspectives at the right time to argue against himself)\\
3.) A dialog should be able to be opened on cards that require clarification, I will also need to decide what players can do with oppositions' cards and also their own.\\
4.) Progress and the app is materializing. I feel great!
