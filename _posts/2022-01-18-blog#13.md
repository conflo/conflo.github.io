### From vue to vuex
It wasn't hard to convert the wise-man app to vuex, a few things I got hung up on

1.) I couldn't access the state variables from actions, turned out I couldn't just use this.$store.state.var, instead, I needed to pass in context to actions as a parameter then do either context.state.var or use getters like context.getters.getVar\\
2.) Turns out Vuex store doesn't have a created() hook so I couldn't initialize the openAI wrapper\\
3.) I should only mutate variables using mutations\\
4.) spreading mapMutations/mapGetters...etc is only for using them in the DOM, otherwise, I can call this.$store.commit/dispatch(payload) in component script\\
5.) I think I should only use getters, there's a complicated reason for it but it's quite nuanced according to the documentation.\\
6.) Apparently, in v-for, using index as key can be problematic if the array is mutable, e.g if you delete an item, the items behind will get assigned new index numbers, using a uuid for key is much better\\
7.) Html class attribute can be dynamic by passing in logical evaluation, this is useful in style
