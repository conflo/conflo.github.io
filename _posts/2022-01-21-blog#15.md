### Vuetify 
Vuetify is great for prototyping user interface since I wouldn't have to type my own html or do any of my own css.\\
Made a simple todo app today using just vuetify components today.

Next is to properly design the debate interface and try out different prompts for appending text to the main text output field. 
I will be using vue3 with the alpha version of vuetify and reproduce the three column wire-frame from v2.x. For now it will be one person arguing both sides.
