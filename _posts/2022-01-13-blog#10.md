### Vue
Turns out I had forgotten everything to do with Vue. Can't believe I actually used this framework to build an XRP wallet. Learning from scratch may take way the heck longer than I initially estimated. Probably a good week to two weeks to get back on track. Some stuff I learned: vue structures, components, emits up the chain, v-bind directives...etc.
