### Vue
Turns out I had forgotten everything to do with Vue. Can't believe I actually used this framework to build an XRP wallet. Learning from scratch may take way the heck longer than I initially estimated. Probably a good week to two weeks to get back on track. Some stuff I learned: vue structures, components, emits up the chain, v-bind directives, ternary operators, spread operatpr...etc.

One key concept, parents pass data to children's props to populate them, as best practice, children should only emit events upwards to request some kinda of method to pass down data for prop change, instead of accesing parents data by inheriting a parent method to access them. This one way communication ensures usability of child components and encapsulation in terms of data scope. Parent object has data and children have props.
