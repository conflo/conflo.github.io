### ConFlo MVP Update #2

There was a weird bug that I couldn't reproduce. I tried to call a method from the DOM and passed in a parameter and it would keep returning the event instead of the ID.
Few things that I was pretty about, I managed to use a ternary properly to dynamically change the class of a v-component. I also managed to retrieve an array object by its ID. It's simple stuff really, but it's a win for me.

Tomorrow, I will work on deciding the structure of the expanded card after doing more reading on the relationship between claim/warrant(reason/grounds)/evidence. I think a lot of these terms are interchangeable depending on the context of the argument, if we arguing about something phyiscal/objective, we would use the term evidence to suggest it verifiability. Whereas to argue for something metaphyisical, we may use the term reason to suggest there's metaphyiscal grounds for the argument instead of something that is objectively verifiable in the outside world. Maybe it would be better for me to use a vague term in order to avoid confusing the users/GPT. 

I am a little bit hung up on the format not being conversation-like enough. I guess for now, the cards really are just a visual representation of the arguments laid out, and a way for the users to perform actions/manipulate them. A dialog should be available to be opened any time to clear any confusions regarding definitions/finer points. 

Keep at it.
