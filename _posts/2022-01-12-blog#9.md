### Prototype
Managed to make a semi-serviceable prototype using Codex.

One problem with Codex sandbox is that the window object doesn't work, so I cannot do pop-up prompts for inputs. Eventually, I will have to move on to some kinda frontend framework for my MVP anyways, so I'm back to Vue.

Since ConFlo is mainly just text input and output, retrieving conversations and calling the openai API here and there, it's not very hardware reliant, I wouldn't need to develop natively. Besides, I suspect for intense conversations that possibly has a time limit, people would prefer to have a proper keyboard. It's a bonus if mobile users want to use the PWA. Apparently quest 2 can do PWAs in firefox reality and the oculus browser, that's pretty interesting too. 

I will keep using Codex to help me test JS stuff though. 

Vue is good for MVP prototyping and I kinda know it so it's a no brainer.

For storing conversations I will probably be using firebase or just some local file somewhere, at least for the prototype.

MVP must haves:

1.) Player UI(prompt, hardcoded instructions + GPT output(uncle?), changing input boxes according to debate stages, output box)\\
2.) Both players connected to the same session and having a conversation concurrently\\
3.) Prompts for formatting the conversation

Basically I will just need to find the most simple chat app tutorial, build it and repurpose some stuff for the formatting. Shouldn't take more than a week... I hope.
